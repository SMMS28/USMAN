- Location-based matching to connect nearby learners and teachers
- Real-time communication tools for seamless interaction
- Rating and review system to ensure quality and trust
- Support for both online and in-person learning modes

1.4 Target Audience
The platform serves:
- Individuals seeking to learn new skills cost-effectively
- Experts wanting to share their knowledge and earn recognition
- Communities looking to strengthen local skill networks
- Educational institutions seeking supplementary learning resources
- Professionals wanting to expand their skill sets

1.5 Project Scope
The project encompasses a full-stack web application with:
- User registration and authentication system
- Profile management with skill listings
- Skill search and matching algorithms
